    "This report is gives a brief summary on the analysis and visualization. This project is motivated and carried out on three datasets derived from the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.\n",
    "<p>This project is carried out three dataframes which have been wrangled to make analysis of the dataframes easier. The dataframes contains info about a tweet made about a dog, the source of the tweet, the number of retweet and favorites the tweet has, the date and time the tweet was posted, the stage of dog, the breed of the dog according to the three different image prediction algorithm. These variables will be analyzed and useful inferences will be deduced from the them concerning the tweets. Let's get started."
